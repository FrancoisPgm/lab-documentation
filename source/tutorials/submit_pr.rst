Submit a GitHub PR
==================

Collaborative working is a key concept of `GitHub <https://github.com/>`_, and as many other groups, we are intensely using this tool for our projects.
You will find lot of github repository examples on `our github organization <https://github.com/SIMEXP>`_.
One important concept is the pull request (PR), or in other terms: requesting for your local code changes to be added into the mainstream code.
