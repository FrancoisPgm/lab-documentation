Submit a GitHub PR
==================

Collaborative working is a key concept of `GitHub <https://github.com/>`_, and as many other groups, we are intensely using this tool for our projects.
You will find lot of github repository examples on `our github organization <https://github.com/SIMEXP>`_.
One important concept is the pull request (PR), or in other terms: requesting for your local code changes to be added into the mainstream code.

Creating a fork
:::::::::::::::

The first step involves creating a fork of the repo you want to modify.
Navigate to the repository page, and click on the fork button (located at the top-right corner of the page).
You will need to select you account from the list.
Now if you navigate to your account, you should see a new repository, it isyour own fork of the original repository!
